1. Searching a product - you need to type in the full product name. for example if a product is named "lerys", you need to type in "lerys" and not lerys to display the search result.
2. Bug Alert - When you back navigate from add product screen(Screen no.2) to products screen(Screen no.1), the data is not displayed the first time, you need to press back button again inorder for data to be loaded. please note this issue does not occur when navigating using the home navigation up 
3. Was not able to upload image in the post payload. may be something wrong in the way I am encoding Multipart.Body
